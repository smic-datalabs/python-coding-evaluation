"""
Implement binary search algorithm to find the index of a given value in a sorted list of numbers.

Binary search algorithm:
1. Compare the given value with the middle element of the list.
2. If the given value is greater than the middle element, consider the right half of the list.
3. Otherwise, consider the left half of the list.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the given value is found or the considered list is empty.

Return the index of the given value or -1 if the value is not found.

Example 1:
    Input list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Search for: 3
    Resulting index: 2

Example 2:
    Input list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Search for: 6
    Resulting index: -1
