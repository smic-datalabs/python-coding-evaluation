"""
Implement bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
- Do not use the built-in sort function.

Bubble sort algorithm:
1. Compare each pair of adjacent elements from the beginning of an array and, if they are in reversed order, swap them.
2. If at least one swap has been done, repeat step 1.
3. Otherwise, stop the algorithm.
