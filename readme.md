# Python Software Engineering Evaluations

This repository contains the code for the Python Software Engineering Evaluations.
It is a collection of Python scripts that are used to evaluate the software engineering skills of Python developers.

## Installation
Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Checking the code
To check the code, run the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```


## Section 1: Problem Solving
The first section of the evaluation is about problem solving. The goal is to solve a number of problems using Python.

The problems are based on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. 

Most of the problems can be solved using a brute force approach. 
However, the goal is to solve the problems using an efficient algorithm.

Do not use any external libraries.

Scoring:
- +1 point for each unit test that passes
- +1 point for an efficient algorithm
- +2 point for a readable and maintainable solution

## Section 2: Object Oriented Programming
The second section of the evaluation is about Object Oriented Programming.

The goal is to implement a number of classes and methods.
