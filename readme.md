# Python Software Engineering Evaluations

This repository contains the code for the Python Software Engineering Evaluations.
It is a collection of Python scripts that are used to evaluate the software engineering skills of Python developers.

## Installation
Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Checking the code
To check the code, run the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```


## Section 1: Basic Syntax and Algorithms
This section of the evaluation is about basic syntax and algorithms. 
The goal is to implement programs and functions that satisfies the task description.

Most of the problems and algorithms required are explained in the task description.

Scoring:
- +1 point for each unit test that passes
- +1 point for proper algorithm implementation if applicable (algorithm is described in the task description)
- +1 point for a readable and maintainable solution

## Section 2: Problem Solving
This section of the evaluation is about problem-solving. The goal is to solve a number of problems using Python.
You need to come up with your own algorithm on how to solve/implement the solutions

Most of the problems are based on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. 

They can be solved using a brute force approach. 
However, the goal is to solve the problems using an efficient algorithm.

Do not use any external libraries.

Scoring:
- +1 point for each unit test that passes
- +1 point for an efficient algorithm
- +2 point for a readable and maintainable solution

## Section 3: Object Oriented Programming
This section of the evaluation is about Object Oriented Programming.
